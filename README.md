# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that scores high scores. The quiz was to meet the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Description
This quiz was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main component was JavaScript. I set up my quiz so that the user has 60 seconds to complete it, and any time they got a question wrong, it docked them by 10 seconds. The user also has the ability to save and view their scores.
